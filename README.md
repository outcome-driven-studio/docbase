```

3. Create storage bucket:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage
   - Create a new public bucket named `cube`

4. **Important:** Apply additional migrations for advanced features:
   - See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed migration instructions
   - Required for: Home dashboard, page-level tracking, and document consolidation

### 5. Start Development Server
